# Google-glazzer

## ðŸ¤” About The Project

Okay, let's address the name: "Google-glazzer". Yes, it uses modern slang. This project is a collection of tools/resources/notes from someone who is genuinely enthusiastic about Google's ecosystem (maybe *too* enthusiastic?). If you love Google tech, you might find something useful here. Call me a glazzer, but Google products are pretty neat!
